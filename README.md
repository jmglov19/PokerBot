# PokerBot

This repository has a fully functionioning poker bot that uses an Effective Card Strength Algorithm in order to make decisions as well as an Evaluation Algorithm that I myself came up with that just finds the percentage chance of getting a certian card score. There is also a ChatGPT algorithm that was made to compare what I could write comapred to what ChatGPT could come up with. It did have to be alteredt to work hence the AddjustedChatGPT file.
